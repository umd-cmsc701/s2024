A list of possible project ideas for the final project has been made available [here](https://hackmd.io/@PI7Og0l1ReeBZu_pjQGUQQ/HyRRGUERj). I will go over the projects briefly in class,
but please feel free to raise any questions or start discussion on any of these projects on Piazza as well. We will also share a Google Sheet shortly where you can begin to 
self-register your final project groups.
